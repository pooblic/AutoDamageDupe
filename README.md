# AutoDamageDupe
Originally discovered by kib023, one of the masterminds of a group none other than Turk30, and further improved to perfection by the developer of [Lunahook Client](https://lunahook.dev), we present to you: AutoDamageDupe, also known by some less informed people as the Gravel Dupe.

Unfortunately, an unnamed skid from an unnamed group snitched on us to jj20051 after failing to reproduce this highly sophisticated dupe method along with his groupmates(well-known rats), so we collectively decided it was time to release this dupe to be used by everyone. Have fun porting this to your clients and please enjoy! AutoDamageDupe on top!

## How to use
Good news: there is an [easy-to-follow video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGUpYO2dtk4) available now!
1. Create a track of sufficient length (same as for FFP dupe)
2. Make a complicated redstone contraption dropping 2 gravel blocks when a lever is toggled
3. Set the track end using `.autoddupe gravel` and set the lever using `.autoddupe lever` while looking at it
4. Move the donkey to the start of the track
5. Dismount the donkey and turk nhub in order to boost the success rate to 100% (optional but highly recommended)
6. Mount the donkey and toggle AutoDamageDupe
7. See magic happen, fully automated!
8. Reconnect after getting disconnected
9. If you think positively of unnamed group or one or more of their members, or if you are a member of it yourself, fuck the newly spawned donkey, otherwise just take the items out
10. PROFIT!
